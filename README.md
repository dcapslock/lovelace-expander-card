Expander/Collapsible card for HomeAssistant  

## Introduction

First a few words to start with. A big thank you goes to [@Alia5](https://github.com/Alia5/lovelace-expander-card), who initially launched the card. I forked this card for my own HomeAssistant to make a few improvements. I give no guarantee for the functionality and no promise of lifelong maintenance, as I do the whole thing in my free time. Of course, I am happy about every contribution and PR

https:

```yaml
      - type: custom:expander-card
        title-card:
          type: custom:mushroom-title-card
          title: |-
            {{ now().hour }}
```

### Simple Title

```yaml
      - type: custom:expander-card
        child-margin-top: 0.6em
        padding: 0
        title: "Test"
        title-card-button-overlay: true
        title-card-clickable: true
        cards:
          - type: custom:simple-weather-card
            entity: weather.openweathermap
            primary_info:
              - wind_speed
              - wind_bearing
            secondary_info:
              - precipitation
              - precipitation_probability
          - type: custom:hourly-weather

            show_precipitation_amounts: true
            forecast_type: "hourly"
            num_segments: 10"
            label_spacing: "1"
            name: null
            show_wind: speed
```

### Title with min-width-expanded

Example with title that is clickable and has 2 nested cards with are automatically expanded when the screen is more than 300px.

```yaml
      - type: custom:expander-card
        child-margin-top: 0.6em
        padding: 0
        title: "Test"
        title-card-button-overlay: true
        title-card-clickable: true
        min-width-expanded: 300
        cards:
          - type: custom:simple-weather-card
            entity: weather.openweathermap
            primary_info:
              - wind_speed
              - wind_bearing
            secondary_info:
              - precipitation
              - precipitation_probability
            name: in Gärtringen
          - type: custom:hourly-weather
            entity: weather.openweathermap
            icons: true

            num_segments: 10"
            label_spacing: "1"
            show_wind: speed
```

### Title card with action 

The configuration below will open or close the expander when you tap the Mushroom Light Card. This means you cannot switch the light on or off by tapping it, but you can still adjust the brightness.

```yaml
    type: custom:expander-card
    title: Expander Card
    expander-card-id: my-light-card
    cards:
      - type: entities
        entities:
          - entity: sun.sun
    title-card:
      type: tile
      entity: light.bed_light
      vertical: false
      features_position: inline
      features:
        - type: light-brightness
      tap_action:
        action: fire-dom-event
        expander-card:
          data:
            expander-card-id: my-light-card
            action: toggle
```
## Set state via action

You can set the state of expander card(s) using the `fire-dom-event` action on any card that supports actions.

1. Set expander card(s) to have `expander-card-id`. Multiple expander cards can shared the same id if you wish to set their state together.
2. Set action on another card using the `fire-dom-event` action.

 ```yaml
  tap_action:
    action: fire-dom-event
    expander-card:
      data:
        expander-card-id: <expander-card-id>
        action: < open | close | toggle >
 ```

Example

### Expander card config

```yaml
    - type: custom:expander-card
      expander-card-id: my-expander-card
```

### Action on another card

```yaml
show_name: true
show_icon: true
type: button
name: Expand my-expander-card
icon: mdi:chevron-down
tap_action:
  action: fire-dom-event
  expander-card:
    data:
      expander-card-id: my-expander-card
      action: open
```

## Style

You can do advanced styling using the `style` configuration parameter. Classes available are per the images below.

![Expander Card Styling - Title](examples/styling1.png)

![Expander Card Styling - Card](examples/styling2.png)

![Expander Card Styling - Card & Overlay](examples/styling3.png)

### State

For all elements shown, the class `open` will be added when the Expander card is open, and `closed` added when the Expander is closed.

### Animation

When Expander card animation is enabled, for all elements except those listed below, the class `opening` will be added when the expander is in the process of opening and the class `closing` will be added when the expander is in the process of closing. When not `opening` or `closing`, the class `idle` will be added. The class `animation` will also be added. You may wish to use these classes for transition affects. Expander card uses `0.35s ease` for transitions. See the final example below for transitioning title font size and color.

> NOTE: `.outer-container` for Title card will not have `animation` or `opening`/`closing` applied.

### Special considerations

1. `.children-wrapper` is used for opening/closing animation and hiding children cards. You should not style this element. It is shown for completeness.
2. `margin-bottom` on each children card's `.outer-container` is used to transition cards sliding down and up while animating. Do not style `margin-bottom` and if altering any transitions, extend the included `transition` style for `opening` and `closing`.
3. As much as possible, use class selector combinations to get your styles to a higher specificity. e.g. `.expander-card.animation.open` is more specific than any built in classes so if you use that selector, you as less likely to need to use `!important`.
4. For animation, during opening, the classes will be `open` and `opening`. During closing, classes will be `open` and `closing` until the close sequence has ended after which the classes will be `close` and `idle`.
5. If you are considering any transition affects, check those already applied and extend those with any styling you add.

### Styling Examples

Using an example to set the background based on the status. As background color is a transition element, you need to style both `open` & `opening` and `close` and `closing` to get the background to transition during opening/closing. Otherwise the transition will take place after the expander has opened/closed.

```yaml
style: |-
  .expander-card.animation.open,
  .expander-card.animation.opening {
    background-color: red;
  }
  .expander-card.animation.close,
  .expander-card.animation.closing {
    background-color: #C8A2C8;
  }
```

Only the background of the button. Here `!important` is needed to override the hover ripple.

```yaml
style: |
  .header.animation.open,
  .header.animation.opening {
    background-color: red !important;
  }
  .header.animation.close,
  .header.animation.closing {
    background-color: #C8A2C8 !important;
  }
```

Switching the arrow from right to left, with reduced horizontal padding of the button.

```yaml
style: |
  .header {
    flex-direction: row-reverse !important;
    padding: 0.8em 0 !important;
  }
```

If you have a title-card

```yaml
style: |
.title-card-header {
  flex-direction: row-reverse !important;
  padding: 0.8em 0 !important;
}
```


Transitioning the title font size and color. Here the `!important` on `close`/`closing` is to make sure that the font size and color both change on `closing` as `open` will still be added until fully closed at which stage `close` will be added and `open` removed.

```yaml
style: |
  .header > .title {
    transition: color 0.35s ease, font-size 0.35s ease;
  }
  .header.animation.close > .title, 
  .header.animation.closing > .title
  {
    color: green !important;
    font-size: var(--ha-font-size-l) !important;
  }
  .header.animation.open > .title,
  .header.animation.opening > .title
  {
    color: red;
    font-size: var(--ha-font-size-m);
  }
```

Change the title size 
```yaml
    style: |
      .title {
        font-size: var(--ha-font-size-l);
      }
```

## Card Mod

Before the `style` attribute, [card mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) was used to style the card. Although card-mod still works, it is better to switch everything to use the `style` attribute. Please do not open issue(s) when card mod is not working.


## Installation

### HACS

Expander-Card is not available in [HACS][hacs] (Home Assistant Community Store) by default, but you can add it as custom repositories.

1. Install HACS if you don't have it already
2. Open HACS in Home Assistant 
3. Add this repository (https://github.com/MelleD/lovelace-expander-card) via HACS Custom repositories ([How to add Custom Repositories](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/))

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=MelleD&repository=lovelace-expander-card&category=plugin)

### Manual

1. Download `expander-card.js` file from the [latest release][release-url].
2. Put `expander-card.js` file into your `config/www` folder.
3. Add reference to `expander-card.js` in Dashboard. There's two way to do that:
    - **Using UI:** _Settings_ → _Dashboards_ → _More Options icon_ → _Resources_ → _Add Resource_ → Set _Url_ as `/local/expander-card.js` → Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.
      **Note:** If you do not see the Resources menu, you will need to enable _Advanced Mode_ in your _User Profile_
    - **Using YAML:** Add following code to `lovelace` section.

      ```yaml
        resources:
            - url: /local/expander-card.js
              type: module
        ```

## FAQ

### Issue after upgrade to HA 2025.6

There is/was an issue after upgrading to HA 2025.6 (maybe with newer version is not valid anymore)
See [forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/expander-accordion-collapsible-card/738817/56?u=melled) and [issue](https://github.com/MelleD/lovelace-expander-card/issues/506) 
a) For the view type [sections](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/) `cards` is not working anymore. You have to rename it to `sections`.

Before

 ```yaml
views:
  - title: MyView
    path: my-view
    cards: ...
```

Now

 ```yaml
views:
  - title: MyView
    path: my-view
    sections: ...
```

### Option Gap is not working

If this option doesn't work, check your browser's console output. Your current CSS layout might not support this option.
You can use the `expander-card-display: grid` option to set a layout that supports this option.
