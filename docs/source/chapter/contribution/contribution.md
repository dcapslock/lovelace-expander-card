### Local Development Setup

#### Build & Install

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
pnpm install

# Start development server
npm run srv

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run es linting
npm run lint

# Fix es linting
npm run lint-fix
```

#### Visual Tests

One-time setup — **VS Code**: open the *Terminal › Run Task* palette and choose *Python: Set up virtual environment*.

One-time setup — **Command line**:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[test]'
playwright install chromium
```

**VS Code** — open the *Terminal › Run Task* palette and choose any `pytest:` task (run all, run single scenario, update snapshots, etc.).

**Command line** — activate the virtual environment first, then:

| Goal | Command |
|---|---|
| All tests | `pytest tests/` |
| All tests — update snapshots & doc images | `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 DOC_IMAGE_UPDATE=1 pytest tests/` |
| Scenario tests only | `pytest tests/visual/test_scenarios.py` |
| Update scenario snapshots | `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 pytest tests/visual/test_scenarios.py` |
| Single scenario | `pytest tests/visual/test_scenarios.py -k expander_01_collapsed` |
| Single scenario — update snapshot | `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 pytest tests/visual/test_scenarios.py -k expander_01_collapsed` |
| Doc images — generate / verify | `pytest tests/visual/test_doc_images.py` |
| Doc images — update all | `DOC_IMAGE_UPDATE=1 pytest tests/visual/test_doc_images.py` |
| Doc image audit (no HA needed) | `pytest tests/test_doc_audit.py` |

> **Tip:** Start the persistent HA server (`python -m ha_testcontainer.ha_server` or the *HA: Start persistent server* VS Code task) before running tests to skip the Docker boot wait on every run.

> **Tip (debugging):** When the persistent server is running, its URL is logged in the terminal. You can open that URL in a browser and log in with the ha-testcontainer default credentials — username `testadmin`, password `testpassword123` — to inspect the HA instance manually. **Do not browse to the instance before running tests**; doing so may interfere with the test session. If you have already browsed to it, stop the server and start it again before running tests.

#### Docs

Go to docs folder and install [zensical](https://zensical.org/docs/get-started/)

```bash
# cd docs
cd docs

# Install zensical https://zensical.org/docs/get-started/
...

# build docs
zensical build --clean

# start server to see updates in realtime
zensical serve
```

Open browser on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
